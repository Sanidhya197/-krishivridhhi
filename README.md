# Krishak_Vriddhi

Farming is a difficult industry to break into. In both small- and large-scale enterprises, farmers encounter a variety of difficulties. Nowadays the farmers face many issues related to farming. Some major issues are land management, food waste, and shortage of the latest technology. The current use of land is harming the soil's nutrition capacity. Sometimes due to drastic changes in weather farmers can't predict what crops they can grow on their farms. That's why to help farmers tackle such issues, I decided to come up with the project "Krishak Vridhhi". Krishak Vridhhi is a website that will be used for agriculture purposes. This website will help farmers to save time, effort, and money while improving their business. but Krishak Vriddhi is now under construction as I am working on some of it's pages
# Objectives of Krishak_vriddhi:
Effective user-friendly dashboard Farmers can also log in and signup to software to keep track of their activities. To design a prediction system that will help in deciding the suitable crop for a particular land area, depending upon land pH level, potassium & nitrogen availability in the soil, and soil type. The user can input the soil data and the type of crop they are growing, and the software will predict what fertilizers we have to use A feature will be offered to farmers using which they can set the time and events in the calendar when they want to spray fertilizers in the field and they will be notified for the same. Weather API to help farmer know about future climatic changes of their area. Without sources like GitHub, YouTube, it's very difficult for me to make this project very user-friendly so I am very grateful to that.

I have deployed this site using Render..check out from here
